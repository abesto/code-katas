Quick hack to quickly get code katas up and running.
It also records your kata by using a branch for each kata "run".
The master branch contains all katas I did using these scripts.
The framework branch contains only the framework.


Example session:


$ ./start.rb

Language:
0. ruby
Choice: 0

Kata:
0. prime-factors
Choice: 0
You can now start working in katas/prime-factors/ruby-20121003-0
When done, just come back here and say ./done.rb
(creates a new branch, checks it out)

# Write test
./test.sh
tests fail (creates a commit with message FAIL)

# Write code
./test.sh
tests pass (creates a commit with message PASS)

# Write test

$ ./done.rb 
Running tests for katas/prime-factors/ruby-20121003-0
Tests failed. Can't finish the kata if tests fail.

# Write code

$ ./done.rb
Running tests for katas/prime-factors/ruby-20121003-0
Grats, that's another one down. Don't forget to push!
(Commits, merges the kata into master, deletes the branch reference)
